Although GNNs have achieved great success in different fields, it is remarkable that GNN models are not good enough to offer satisfying solutions for any graph in any condition. In this section, we list some open problems for further researches.

**Robustness.** As a family of models based on neural networks, GNNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Compared to adversarial attacks on images or text which only focuses on features, attacks on graphs further consider the structural information. Several works have been proposed to attack existing graph models (Zugner et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2018) and more robust models are proposed to defend (Zhu et al., 2019). We refer to (Sun et al., 2018) for a comprehensive review.

**Interpretability.** Interpretability is also an important research direction for neural models. But GNNs are also black-boxes and lack of explanations. Only a few methods (Ying et al., 2019; Baldassarre and Azizpour, 2019) are proposed to generate example-level explanations for GNN models. It is important to apply GNN models on real-world applications with trusted explanations. Similar to the fields of CV and NLP, interpretability on graphs is also an important direction to investigate.

**Graph Pretraining.** Neural network-based models require abundant labeled data and it is costly to obtain enormous human-labeled data. Self-supervised methods are proposed to guide models to learn from unlabeled data which is easy to obtain from websites or knowledge bases. These methods have achieved great success in the area of CV and NLP with the idea of pretraining (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Devlin et al., 2019). Recently, there have been works focusing on pretraining on graphs (Qiu et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020), but they have different problem settings and focus on different aspects. This field still has many open problems requiring research efforts, such as the design of the pretraining tasks, the effectiveness of existing GNN models on learning structural or feature information, etc.

**Complex Graph Structures.** Graph structures are flexible and complex in real life applications. Various works are proposed to deal with complex graph structures such as dynamic graphs or heterogeneous graphs as we have discussed before. With the rapid development of social networks on the Internet, there are certainly more problems, challenges and application scenarios emerging and requiring more powerful models.
