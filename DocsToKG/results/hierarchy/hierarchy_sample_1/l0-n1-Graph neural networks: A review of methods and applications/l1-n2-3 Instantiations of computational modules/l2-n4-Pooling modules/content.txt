In the area of computer vision, a convolutional layer is usually followed by a pooling layer to get more general features. Complicated and large-scale graphs usually carry rich hierarchical structures which are of great importance for node-level and graph-level classification tasks. Similar to these pooling layers, a lot of work focuses on designing hierarchical pooling layers on graphs. In this section, we introduce two kinds of pooling modules: direct pooling modules and hierarchical pooling modules.
