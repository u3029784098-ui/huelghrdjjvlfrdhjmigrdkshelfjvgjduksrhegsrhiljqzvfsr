In this section we introduce existing instantiations of three computational modules: propagation modules, sampling modules and pooling modules. We introduce three sub-components of propagation modules: convolution operator, recurrent operator and skip connection in Section 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 respectively. Then we introduce sampling modules and pooling modules in Section 3.4 and 3.5. An overview of computational modules is shown in Fig. 3.
