GNN models aggregate messages for each node from its neighborhood in the previous layer. Intuitively, if we track back multiple GNN layers, the size of supporting neighbors will grow exponentially with the depth. To alleviate this "neighbor explosion" issue, an efficient and efficacious way is sampling. Besides, when we deal with large graphs, we cannot always store and process all neighborhood information for each node, thus the sampling module is needed to conduct the propagation. In this section, we introduce three kinds of graph sampling modules: node sampling, layer sampling, and subgraph sampling.
