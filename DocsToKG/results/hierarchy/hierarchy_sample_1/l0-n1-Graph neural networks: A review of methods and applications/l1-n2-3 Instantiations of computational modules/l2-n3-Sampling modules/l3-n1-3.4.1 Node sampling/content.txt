A straightforward way to reduce the size of neighboring nodes would be selecting a subset from each node's neighborhood. GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017) samples a fixed small number of neighbors, ensuring a 2 to 50 neighborhood size for each node. To reduce sampling variance, Chen et al. (2018) introduce a control-variate based stochastic approximation algorithm for GCN by utilizing the historical activations of nodes as a control variate. This method limits the receptive field in the 1-hop neighborhood, and uses the historical hidden state as an affordable approximation.

PinSage (Ying et al., 2018) proposes importance-based sampling method. By simulating random walks starting from target nodes, this approach chooses the top T nodes with the highest normalized visit counts.
