Rather than sampling nodes and edges which builds upon the full graph, a fundamentally different way is to sample multiple subgraphs and restrict the neighborhood search within these subgraphs. ClusterGCN (Chiang et al., 2019) samples subgraphs by graph clustering algorithms, while GraphSAINT (Zeng et al., 2020) directly samples nodes or edges to generate a subgraph.
