At first, we have to find out the graph structure in the application. There are usually two scenarios: structural scenarios and non-structural scenarios. In structural scenarios, the graph structure is explicit in the applications, such as applications on molecules, physical systems, knowledge graphs and so on. In non-structural scenarios, graphs are implicit so that we have to first build the graph from the task, such as building a fully-connected "word" graph for text or building a scene graph for an image. After we get the graph, the later design process attempts to find an optimal GNN model on this specific graph.
