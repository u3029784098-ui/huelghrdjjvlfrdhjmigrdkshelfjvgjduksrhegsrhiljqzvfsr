After we get the graph in the application, we then have to find out the graph type and its scale.

Graphs with complex types could provide more information on nodes and their connections. Graphs are usually categorized as:

* **Directed/Undirected Graphs.** Edges in directed graphs are all directed from one node to another, which provide more information than undirected graphs. Each edge in undirected graphs can also be regarded as two directed edges.
* **Homogeneous/Heterogeneous Graphs.** Nodes and edges in homogeneous graphs have same types, while nodes and edges have different types in heterogeneous graphs. Types for nodes and edges play important roles in heterogeneous graphs and should be further considered.
* **Static/Dynamic Graphs.** When input features or the topology of the graph vary with time, the graph is regarded as a dynamic graph. The time information should be carefully considered in dynamic graphs.

Note these categories are orthogonal, which means these types can be combined, e.g. one can deal with a dynamic directed heterogeneous graph. There are also several other graph types designed for different tasks such as hypergraphs and signed graphs. We will not enumerate all types here but the most important idea is to consider the additional information provided by these graphs. Once we specify the graph type, the additional information provided by these graph types should be further considered in the design process.

As for the graph scale, there is no clear classification criterion for "small" and "large" graphs. The criterion is still changing with the development of computation devices (e.g. the speed and memory of GPUs). In this paper, when the adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian of a graph (the space complexity is \(O(n^{2})\)) cannot be stored and processed by the device, then we regard the graph as a large-scale graph and then some sampling methods should be considered.
