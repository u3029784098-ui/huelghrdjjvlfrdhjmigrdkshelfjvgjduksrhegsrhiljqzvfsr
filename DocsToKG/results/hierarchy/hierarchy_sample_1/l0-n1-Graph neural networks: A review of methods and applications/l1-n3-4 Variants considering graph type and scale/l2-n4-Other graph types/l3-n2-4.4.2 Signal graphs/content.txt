Signed graphs are the graphs with signed edges, i.e. an edge can be either positive or negative. Instead of simply treating the negative edges as the absent edges or another type of edges, SGCN (Derr et al., 2018) utilizes balance theory to capture the interactions between positive edges and negative edges. Intuitively, balance theory suggests that the friend (positive edge) of my friend is also my friend and the enemy (negative edge) of my enemy is my friend. Therefore it provides theoretical foundation for SGCN to model the interactions between positive edges and negative edges.
