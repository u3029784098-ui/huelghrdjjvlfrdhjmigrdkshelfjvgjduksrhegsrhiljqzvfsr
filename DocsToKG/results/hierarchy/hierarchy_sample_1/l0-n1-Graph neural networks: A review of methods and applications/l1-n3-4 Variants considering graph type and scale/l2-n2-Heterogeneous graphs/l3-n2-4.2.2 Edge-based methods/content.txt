There are also works which don't utilize meta-paths. These works typically use different functions in terms of sampling, aggregation, etc. for different kinds of neighbors and edges. HetGNN (Zhang et al., 2019) addresses the challenge by directly treating neighbors of different types differently in sampling, feature encoding and aggregation steps. HGT (Hu et al., 2020) defines the meta-relation to be the type of two neighboring nodes and their link \((\varphi(\nu),\psi(e_{i}),\varphi(\nu))\). It assigns different attention weight matrices to different meta-relations, empowering the model to take type information into consideration.
