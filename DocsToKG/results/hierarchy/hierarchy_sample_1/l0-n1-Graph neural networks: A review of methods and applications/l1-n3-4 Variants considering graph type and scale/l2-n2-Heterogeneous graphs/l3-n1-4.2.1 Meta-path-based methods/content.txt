Most approaches toward this graph type utilize the concept of meta-path. Meta-path is a path scheme which determines the type of node in each position of the path, e.g., \(\varphi_{1}\)-\(\varphi_{2}\)-\(\varphi_{3}\)-\(\varphi_{4}\)-\(\varphi_{5}\)-\(\varphi_{6}\)-\(\varphi_{7}\), where \(L\) is the length of the meta-path. In the training process, the meta-paths are instantiated as node sequences. By connecting the two end nodes of a meta-path instances, the meta-path captures the similarity of two nodes which may not be directly connected. Consequently, one heterogeneous graph can be reduced to several homogeneous graphs, on which graph learning algorithms can be applied. In early work, meta-path based similarity search is investigated (Sun et al., 2011). Recently, more GNN models which utilize the meta-path are proposed. HAN (Wang et al., 2019) first performs graph attention on the meta-path-based neighbors under each meta-path and then uses a semantic attention over output embeddings of nodes under all meta-path schemes to generate the final representation of nodes. MAGNN (Fu et al., 2020) proposes to take the intermediate nodes in a meta-path into consideration. It first aggregates the information along the meta-path using a neural module and then performs attention over different meta-path instances associated with a node and finally performs attention over different meta-path schemes. GTN (Yun et al., 2019) proposes a novel graph transformer layer which identifies new connections between unconnected nodes while learning representations of nodes. The learned new connections can connect nodes which are serveral hops away from each other but are closely related, which function as the meta-paths.
