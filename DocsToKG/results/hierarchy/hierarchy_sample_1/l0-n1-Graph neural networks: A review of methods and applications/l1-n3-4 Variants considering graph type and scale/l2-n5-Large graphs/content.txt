As we mentioned in Section 3.4, sampling operators are usually used to process large-scale graphs. Besides sampling techniques, there are also other methods for the scaling problem. Leveraging approximate personalized PageRank, methods proposed by Klicpera et al. (2019) and Bojchevski et al. (2020) avoid calculating high-order propagation matrices. Rossi et al. (2020) propose a method to precompute graph convolutional filters of different sizes for efficient training and inference. PageRank-based models squeeze multiple GCN layers into one single propagation layer to mitigate the "neighbor explosion" issue, hence are highly scalable and efficient.
