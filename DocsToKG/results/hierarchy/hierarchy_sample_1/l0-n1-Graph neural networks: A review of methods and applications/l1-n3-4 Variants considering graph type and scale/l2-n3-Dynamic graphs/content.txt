Another variant of graphs is dynamic graphs, in which the graph structure, e.g. the existence of edges and nodes, keeps changing over time. To model the graph structured data together with the time series data, DCRNN (Li et al., 2018) and STGCN (Yu et al., 2018) first collect spatial information by GNNs, then feed the outputs into a sequence model like sequence-to-sequence models or RNNs. Differently, Structural-RNN (Jain et al., 2016) and ST-GCN (Yan et al., 2018) collect spatial and temporal messages at the same time. They extend static graph structure with temporal connections so they can apply traditional GNNs on the extended graphs. Similarly, DGNN (Manessi et al., 2020) feeds the output embeddings of each node from the GCN into separate LSTMs. The weights of LSTMs are shared between each node. On the other hand, EvolveGCN (Pareja et al., 2020) argues that directly modeling dynamics of the node representation will hamper the model's performance on graphs where node set keeps changing. Therefore, instead of treating node features as the input to RNN, it feeds the weights of the GCN into the RNN to capture the intrinsic dynamics of the graph interactions. Recently, a survey (Huang et al., 2020) classifies the dynamic networks into several categories based on the link duration, and groups the existing models into these categories according to their specialization. It also establishes a general framework for models of dynamic graphs and fits existing models into the general framework.
