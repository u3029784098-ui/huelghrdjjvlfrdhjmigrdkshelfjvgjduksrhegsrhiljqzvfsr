The first type is the directed graphs. Directed edges usually contain more information than undirected edges. For example, in a knowledge graph where a head entity is the parent class of a tail entity, the edge direction offers information about the partial order. Instead of simply adopting an asymmetric adjacency matrix in the convolution operator, we can model the forward and reverse directions of an edge differently. DGP (Kampffmeyer et al., 2019) uses two kinds of weight matrices \(\mathbf{W}_{p}\) and \(\mathbf{W}_{c}\) for the convolution in forward and reverse directions.
