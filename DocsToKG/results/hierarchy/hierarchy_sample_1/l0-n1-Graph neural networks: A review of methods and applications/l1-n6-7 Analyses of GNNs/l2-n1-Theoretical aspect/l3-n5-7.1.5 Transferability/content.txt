A deterministic characteristic of GNNs is that the parameterization is united with graphs, which suggests the ability to transfer across graphs (so-called transferability) with performance guarantees. Levie et al. (2019) investigate the transferability of spectral graph filters, showing that such filters are able to transfer on graphs in the same domain. Ruiz et al. (2020) analyze GNN behaviour on graphons. Graphon refers to the limit of a sequence of graphs, which can also be seen as a generator for dense graphs. The authors conclude that GNNs are transferable across graphs obtained deterministically from the same graphon with different sizes.
