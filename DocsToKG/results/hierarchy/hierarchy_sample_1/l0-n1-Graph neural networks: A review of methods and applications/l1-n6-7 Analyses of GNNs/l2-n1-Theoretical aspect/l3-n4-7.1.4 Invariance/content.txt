As there are no node orders in graphs, the output embeddings of GNNs are supposed to be permutation-invariant or equivariant to the input features. Maron et al. (2019) characterize permutation-invariant or equivariant linear layers to build invariant GNNs. Maron et al. (2019) further prove the result that the universal invariant GNNs can be obtained with higher-order tensorization. Keriven and Peyre (2019) provide an alternative proof and extend this conclusion to the equivariant case. Chen et al. (2019) build connections between permutation-invariance and graph isomorphism testing. To prove their equivalence, Chen et al. (2019) leverage sigma-algebra to describe the expressivity of GNNs.
