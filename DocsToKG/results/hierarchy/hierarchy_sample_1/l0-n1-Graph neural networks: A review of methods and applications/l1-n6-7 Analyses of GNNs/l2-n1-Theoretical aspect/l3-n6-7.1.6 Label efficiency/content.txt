(Semi-) Supervised learning for GNNs needs a considerable amount of labeled data to achieve a satisfying performance. Improving the label efficiency has been studied in the perspective of active learning, in which informative nodes are actively selected to be labeled by an oracle to train the GNNs. Cai et al. (2017), Gao et al. (2018), Hu et al. (2020) demonstrate that by selecting the informative nodes such as the high-degree nodes and uncertain nodes, the labeling efficiency can be dramatically improved.
