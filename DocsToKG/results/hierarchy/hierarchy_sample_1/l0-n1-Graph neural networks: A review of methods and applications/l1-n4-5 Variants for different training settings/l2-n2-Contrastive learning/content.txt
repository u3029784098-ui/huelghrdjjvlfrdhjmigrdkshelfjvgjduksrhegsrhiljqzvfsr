Besides graph auto-encoders, contrastive learning paves another way for unsupervised graph representation learning. Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) (Velickovic et al., 2019) maximizes mutual information between node representations and graph representations. Infograph (Sun et al., 2020) aims to learn graph representations by mutual information maximization between graph-level representations and the substructure-level representations of different scales including nodes, edges and triangles. Multi-view (Hassani and Khasahmadi, 2020) contrasts representations from first-order adjacency matrix and graph diffusion, achieves state-of-the-art performances on multiple graph learning tasks.
