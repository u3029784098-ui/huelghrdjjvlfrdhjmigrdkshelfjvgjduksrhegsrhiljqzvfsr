Over the past few years, graph neural networks have become powerful and practical tools for machine learning tasks in graph domain. This progress owes to advances in expressive power, model flexibility, and training algorithms. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of graph neural networks. For GNN models, we introduce its variants categorized by computation modules, graph types, and training types. Moreover, we also summarize several general frameworks and introduce several theoretical analyses. In terms of application taxonomy, we divide the GNN applications into structural scenarios, non-structural scenarios, and other scenarios, then give a detailed review for applications in each scenario. Finally, we suggest four open problems indicating the major challenges and future research directions of graph neural networks, including robustness, interpretability, pretraining and complex structure modeling.
