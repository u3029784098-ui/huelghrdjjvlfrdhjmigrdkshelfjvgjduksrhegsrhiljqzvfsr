Graph neural networks have been explored in a wide range of domains across supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning settings. In this section, we generally group the applications in two scenarios: (1) Structural scenarios where the data has explicit relational structure. These scenarios, on the one hand, emerge from scientific researches, such as graph mining, modeling physical systems and chemical systems. On the other hand, they rise from industrial applications such as knowledge graphs, traffic networks and recommendation systems. (2) Non-structural scenarios where the relational structure is implicit or absent. These scenarios generally include image (computer vision) and text (natural language processing), which are two of the most actively developing branches of AI researches. A simple illustration of these applications is in Fig. 6. Note that we only list several representative applications instead of providing an exhaustive list. The summary of the applications could be found in Table 3.
