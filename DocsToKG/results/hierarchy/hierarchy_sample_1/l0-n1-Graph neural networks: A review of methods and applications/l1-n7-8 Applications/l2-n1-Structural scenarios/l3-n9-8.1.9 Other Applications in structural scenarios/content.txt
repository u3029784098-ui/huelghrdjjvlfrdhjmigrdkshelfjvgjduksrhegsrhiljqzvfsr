Because of the ubiquity of graph-structured data, GNNs have been applied to a larger variety of tasks than what we have introduced above. We list more scenarios very briefly. In financial market, GNNs are used to model the interaction between different stocks to predict the future trends of the stocks (Matsunaga et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020). Kim et al. (2019) also predict the market index movement by formulating it as a graph classification problem. In Software-Defined Networks (SDN), GNNs are used to optimize the routing performance (Pusket et al., 2019). In Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph to Text generation tasks, Song et al. (2018), Beck et al. (2018) use GNNs to encode the graph representation of the abstract meaning.
