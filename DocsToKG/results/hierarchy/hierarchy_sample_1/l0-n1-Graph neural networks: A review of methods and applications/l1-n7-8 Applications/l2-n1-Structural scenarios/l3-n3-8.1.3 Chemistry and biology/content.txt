**Molecular Fingerprints.** Molecular fingerprints serve as a way to encode the structure of molecules. The simplest fingerprint can be a one-hot vector, where each digit represents the existence or absence of a particular substructure. These fingerprints can be used in molecule searching, which is a core step in computer-aided drug design. Conventional molecular fingerprints are hand-made and fixed (e.g., the one-hot vector). However, molecules can be naturally seen as graphs, with atoms being the nodes and chemical-bonds being the edges. Therefore, by applying GNNs to molecular graphs, we can obtain better fingerprints.

Duvenaud et al. (2015) propose neural graph fingerprints (Neural FPs), which calculate substructure feature vectors via GCNs and sum to get overall representations. Kearnes et al. (2016) explicitly model atom and atom pairs independently to emphasize atom interactions. It introduces edge representation \(\textbf{e}_{uv}^{t}\) instead of aggregation function, i.e. \(\textbf{h}_{\ell^{\prime}_{v}}^{t}=\sum\limits_{\textbf{u}\in\mathcal{T}(v)} \textbf{e}_{uv}^{t}\).

**Chemical Reaction Prediction.** Chemical reaction product prediction is a fundamental issue in organic chemistry. Graph Transformation Policy Network (Do et al., 2019) encodes the input molecules and generates an intermediate graph with a node pair prediction network and a policy network.

**Protein Interface Prediction.** Proteins interact with each other using the interface, which is formed by the amino acid residues from each participating protein. The protein interface prediction task is to determine whether particular residues constitute part of a protein. Generally, the prediction for a single residue depends on other neighboring residues. By letting the residues to be nodes, the proteins can be represented as graphs, which can leverage the GNN-based machine learning algorithms. Fout et al. (2017) propose a GCN-based method to learn ligand and receptor protein residue representation and to merge them for pair-wise classification. MR-GNN (Xu et al., 2019d) introduces a multi-resolution approach to extract and summarize local and global features for better prediction.

**Biomedical Engineering.** With Protein-Protein Interaction Network, Rhee et al. (2018) leverage graph convolution and relation network for breast cancer subtype classification. Zitnik et al. (2018) also suggest a GCN-based model for polypharmacy side effects prediction. Their work models the drug and protein interaction network and separately deals with edges in different types.
