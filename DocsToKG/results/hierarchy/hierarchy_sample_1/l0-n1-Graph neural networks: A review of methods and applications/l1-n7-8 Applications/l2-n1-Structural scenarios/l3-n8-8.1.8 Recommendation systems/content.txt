User-item interaction prediction is one of the classic problems in recommendation. By modeling the interaction as a graph, GNNs can be utilized in this area. GC-MC (van den Berg et al., 2017) firstly applies GCN on user-item rating graphs to learn user and item embeddings. To efficiently adopt GNNs in web-scale scenarios, PinSage (Ying et al., 2018) builds computational graphs with weighted sampling strategy for the bipartite graph to reduce repeated computation.

Social recommendation tries to incorporate user social networks to enhance recommendation performance. GraphRec (Fan et al., 2019) learns user embeddings from both item side and user side. Wu et al. (2019) go beyond static social effects. They attempt to model homophily and influence effects by dual attentions.
