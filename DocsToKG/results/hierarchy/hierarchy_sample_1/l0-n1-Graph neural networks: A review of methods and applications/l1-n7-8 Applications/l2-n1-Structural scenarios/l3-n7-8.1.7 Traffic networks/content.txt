Predicting traffic states is a challenging task since traffic networks are dynamic and have complex dependencies. Cui et al. (2018) combine GNNs and LSTMs to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies. STGCN (Yu et al., 2018) constructs ST-Conv blocks with spatial and temporal convolution layers, and applies residual connection with bottleneck strategies. Zheng et al. (2020), Guo et al. (2019) both incorporate attention mechanism to better model spatial temporal correlation.
