The first application is to solve the basic tasks in graph mining. Generally, graph mining algorithms are used to identify useful structures for downstream tasks. Traditional graph mining challenges include frequent sub-graph mining, graph matching, graph classification, graph clustering, etc. Although with deep learning, some downstream tasks can be directly solved without graph mining as an intermediate step, the basic challenges are worth being studied in the GNNs' perspective.

**Graph Matching.** The first challenge is graph matching. Traditional methods for graph matching usually suffer from high computational complexity. The emergence of GNNs allows researchers to capture the structure of graphs using neural networks, thus offering another solution to the problem. Riba et al. (2018) propose a siamese MPNN model to learn the graph editing distance. The Siamese framework is two parallel MPNNs with the same structure and weight sharing. The training objective is to embed a pair of graphs with small editing distance into close latent space. Li et al. (2019) design similar methods while experiments on more real-world scenario such as similarity search in control flow graph.

**Graph Clustering**. Graph clustering is to group the vertices of a graph into clusters based on the graph structure and/or node attributes. Various works (Zhang et al., 2019c) in node representation learning are developed and the representation of nodes can be passed to traditional clustering algorithms. Apart of learning node embeddings, graph pooling (Ying et al., 2018b) can be seen as a kind of clustering. More recently, Tsitsulin et al. (2020) directly target at the clustering task. They study the desirable property of a good graph clustering method and propose to optimize the spectral modularity, which is a remarkably useful graph clustering metric.
