In this section we will talk about applications on non-structural scenarios. Generally, there are two ways to apply GNNs on non-structuralscenarios: (1) Incorporate structural information from other domains to improve the performance, for example using information from knowledge graphs to alleviate the zero-shot problems in image tasks; (2) Infer or assume the relational structure in the task and then apply the model to solve the problems defined on graphs, such as the method in (Zhang et al., 2018) which models text into graphs. Common non-structure scenarios include image, text, and programming source code (Allamanis et al., 2018; Li et al., 2016). However, we only give detailed introduction to the first two scenarios.
