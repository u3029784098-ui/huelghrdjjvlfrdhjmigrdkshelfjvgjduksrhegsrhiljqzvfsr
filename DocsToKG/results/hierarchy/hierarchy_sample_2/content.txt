while the kernel weights are structured as (\(N_{\rm slice},N_{\rm time}\)). This precomputation significantly accelerates our calculations, which is essential since the longitudinal slices are at least partially degenerate with one another. Consequently, the fits require more steps and walkers to ensure proper convergence.

To address this, we follow a similar approach to our sinusoidal fits using emcee, but we increase the total number of steps to 100,000 and use 100 walkers. Naively, the fit would include \(2N_{\rm slice}+1\) parameters: \(N_{\rm slice}\) for the albedo values, \(N_{\rm slice}\) for the emission parameters, and one additional scatter parameter, \(\sigma\). However, since night-side slices do not contribute to the reflected light component, we exclude these albedo values from the fit. In any case, our choice of 100 walkers ensures a sufficient number of walkers per free parameter. Following Coulombe et al. (2025) we set an upper prior limit of 3/2 on all albedo slices as a fully Lambertian sphere (\(A_{i}=1\)) corresponds to a geometric albedo of \(A_{\rm g}=2/3\). For thermal emission we impose a uniform prior between 0 and 500 ppm for each slice.

We choose to fit our detrended lightcurves considering 4, 6 and 8 longitudinal slices (\(N_{\rm slice}=4,6,8\)). However, we show the results of the simplest 4 slice model. As in our previous fits, we conduct an initial run with 25,000 steps (25% of the total run) and use the maximum-probability parameters from this preliminary fit as the starting positions for the final 75,000-step run. We then discard the first 60% of the final run as burn-in.
