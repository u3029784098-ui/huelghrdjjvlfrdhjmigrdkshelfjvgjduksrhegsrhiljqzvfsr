Please update the application UI with the following changes:

1. Rename the "Manage projects" tab to "Projects".
2. Rename the "Generate graph" tab to "Build graph".
3. Add a new "Statistics" tab to the sidebar and create a corresponding component at `components/Statistics.tsx`.
4. Reorganize the sidebar tabs in the following order: Projects, Build graph, Statistics, Evaluation, Operations, Settings.

Ensure all changes are reflected in both the UI and the routing logic. Refer to your framework's documentation for updating navigation and component structure.
