These forces differ greatly in strength, range, and the particles they act on. Each force is mediated by specific gauge bosons, which are the force carriers in quantum field theory. Together, these interactions shape the behavior of matter and energy at all scales, from the structure of atoms to the evolution of the universe.

- Gravitational Force: A universal attractive force acting between all particles with mass or energy; weakest of the four forces but with infinite range.

- Electromagnetic Force: A force between particles with electric charge; responsible for electric and magnetic fields, with infinite range and mediated by photons.

- Strong Interaction: The force that binds quarks into hadrons and holds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei; the strongest force but short-ranged.

- Weak Interaction: A force responsible for processes like beta decay; acts on all fermions, affects flavor, and has a very short range; mediated by W and Z bosons.""" .

Because of the presence of the strange quark, hyperons are heavier than protons and neutrons, and they are generally unstable, decaying via the weak interaction into lighter particles. Examples include the Lambda (Λ), Sigma (Σ), Xi (Ξ), and Omega (Ω) particles. Hyperons are commonly produced in high-energy collisions and are studied to understand the behavior of quarks beyond the first generation, as well as the strong force in more exotic systems." .
